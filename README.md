# VisualizeCovid

## Overview
A webapp built using Django and Python to help visualize data on the COVID19 outbreak. Currently, the source for the data is the Coronavirus COVID19 API (https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc?version=latest).

The live version can be found here: [visualizecovid19.herokuapp.com](https://visualizecovid.herokuapp.com/)

## Purpose
I wanted to stop the spread of misinformation and help people realize just how serious this outbreak is, while at the same time have a go at a chance to learn.
